0.  BMP is 32 bit and it can also be 24 bit
       for 32 bit over 4.2 billion or 2^32 color 
       for 24 bit over 16.7 million or 2^24 color
    GIF is 8 bit i.e 256 or 2^8 color
    JPEG is 24 bit i.e over 16.7 million or 2^24 color
    PNG is also 24 bit i.e over 16.7 million or 2^24 color

1.  GIF supports animation

2.  In lossy compression information or original data can not be recovered 
    back exactly as it was initially so after compression the file recovered
    has some of the data missing usually redundant data thus reducing
    the squality of image ex- JPEG 
    A lossless compression is a compression in which a file can be completly
    recovered after uncompressing it ex - GIF & PNG
    
3.  JPEG  is a lossy compression format

4.  In FAT when a file is deleted only the information in the 
    address table is erased while the actual content of file remains
    intact in the harddisk
    
5.  delete the file with some usefull tool which not only
    removes the information from address table but also 
    rewrite the memory occupied by file on hardisk by zeroes
    
6.  stdint.h is a header file that declares specified integer
    types as having a certain width
    
7.  It makes clear that we intend to use the data in a specific way
    for some specific work so as to get int of specific size
	uint24_t means an integer that is exactly 24 bits wide
	
8.  BYTE size = 1 byte
    Dword size = 4 bytes
    LONG size = 4 bytes
    WORD size = 2 bytes

9.  The first two bytes of a BMP is a WORD and denotes bfType, 
    which specifies the file type.
    It must be  the signature word BM (0x4D42) to indicate bitmap

10. bfSize represents the the size of the whole file including 
    padding and headerfiles
    while biSize is the number of bytes required by the structure 
    

11. If biHeight is positive, the bitmap is a bottom-up DIB (device-independent bitmap)
	and its origin is the lower left corner
	while if it is negative it is a top-down DIB and its
	origin is the upper left corner

12. The biBitCount member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure 
    determines the number ofbits that define each pixel and
    the maximum number of colors in the bitmap

13. It may return null if fopen is not able to create the file 

14. Because we want to read just one block of given size at a time 
    here in our code we just want to read 1 RGB or just 1 pixel at 
    a time
    
15. If bi.biWidth = 3 then padding = 3 bytes

16. It skips over the padding in any line and look for next pixel 

17. This is an integer constant which, when used as the whence argument
    to the fseek ,specifies that the offset provided is relative to the 
    current file position
